# Speed Typing Test

## Overview

Welcome to the Speed Typing Test! This command-line application tests your typing speed by displaying a random line of text and measuring your words per minute (WPM) as you type. The application is implemented in Python using the `curses` library.

## How to Use

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Clone the repository or download the Python script (`speed_typing_test.py`).

2. **Run the Application:**

     python speed_typing_test.py
     ```

3. **Instructions:**
   - Press any key to start the typing test.
   - Type the displayed text as accurately and quickly as possible.
   - The application will calculate your WPM in real-time and display color-coded feedback for correct and incorrect characters.

4. **Completion:**
   - After completing the test, a completion message will be displayed.
   - Press any key to start a new test.
